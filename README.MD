React components communicate with the backend using axios for asynchronous data fetching.

## Tech Stack

## Project Structure


- The frontend part of this page is made up of different pages on the same SPA website; a list of categories with a detailed view of classified expenses, a user profile and a form to add new expenses. Components rendered with React communicate with the database via axios and fetch async.
- The backend part of this application is organized into routes, controllers, models and queries, since the database is developed in Postgres, since it is a relational SQL database.
